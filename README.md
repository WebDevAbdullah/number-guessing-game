# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple number guessing game implemented in TypeScript. The game randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess the number within a limited number of attempts based on the selected difficulty level.

This project is based on the roadmap for the [Number Guessing Game](https://roadmap.sh/projects/number-guessing-game).

## Features

- Three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard.
- Provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.
- Displays the result at the end of the game.
- Allow the user to play multiple rounds of the game
